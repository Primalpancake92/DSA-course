# Data Structures and Algorithms course 

This is a UTS inspired free online resource that I have written as a UTS student, during my self studies. I have made this course with the intended purpose of making notes for myself to aid my preparation for the course and beyond. Hope that whoever is using this may benefit from this repository.
